        faqs:
          - question: "Is there really a free trial?"
            answer: "Yes! All plans come with a 14-day free trial. No credit card required to start. You can explore all features and decide if it's right for you."
          - question: "Can I change plans later?"
            answer: "Absolutely. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Changes take effect immediately, and we'll prorate any billing differences."
          - question: "What payment methods do you accept?"
            answer: "We accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) and PayPal. Enterprise customers can also pay by invoice."
          - question: "Do you offer discounts for annual billing?"
            answer: "Yes! Save 20% when you pay annually. That's like getting 2 months free on the Professional plan."
          - question: "What happens if I exceed my project limit?"
            answer: "You'll receive a notification and can either upgrade your plan or archive old projects. We'll never surprise you with charges."
          - question: "Can I cancel anytime?"
            answer: "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Your projects will remain accessible until the end of your billing period."
